# Jordy Cuts
It's been nearly 10 years since I learned how to cut my own hair. As I began to get better, I was trusted by my peers to cut their hair as well.

From ROTC students to last minute formal dates, I began to acquire more and more clients. Jordy Cuts is a web based scheduler, where clients can choose a desired date, and type of haircut and the owner can respond through comments, and update statuses depending on feasibility.
